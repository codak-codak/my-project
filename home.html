  <h3>Author: Okafor Ifunanya</h3>

  <p style="font-size: medium; font-family: fantasy;">Mark Twaine once said:<br><i><blockquote>There are two most important dates in your life; first is, the day you're bron, second is the day you figure out why"</blockquote></i></p>
  <br> God has never created anything without a purpose. God does not create things without a reason. So, if your heart is beating, then you have a purpose. If you want to know the pupose of your life; start with God.
  <br><i><blockquote>You can't tell you what your purpose is because you didnt create you</blockquote></i>
  <br>The manufacturer/inventor knows the reason for his invention. Talk to your Creator and read the owner's manual.
  <br><i><blockquote>Ephesians 1:11-12:</blockquote></i>
  <br><i><blockquote>It is in Christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for... part of the overall purpose He is working out in everything and everyone</blockquote></i>
